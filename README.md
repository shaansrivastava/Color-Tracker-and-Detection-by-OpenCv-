# Color-Tracker-and-Detection-by-OpenCv

My first project on OpenCv library.
This will enable the user to set the colour he wants to track through the trackbar.
The user has to set the upper and lower hue,saturation and value attributes i.e. HSV values.
The project contains a basic code of OpenCv and Python.
